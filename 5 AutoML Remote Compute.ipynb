    "# Lab 5 - Automated ML \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab you have trained a first machine learning (ML) model on the diabetes dataset. Model training is a very iterative process and typically requires multiple iterations to improve upon an existing model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automated machine learning - or Auto ML for short - is the process of automating the time consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality. Automated ML is based on a breakthrough from our [Microsoft Research division](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05355).\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply automated ML when you want Azure Machine Learning to train and tune a model for you using the target metric you specify. The service then iterates through ML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The higher the score, the better the model is considered to fit your data.\n",
    "With automated machine learning, you'll accelerate the time it takes to get production-ready ML models with great ease and efficiency.\n",

    "## When to use Auto ML\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated ML democratizes the machine learning model development process, and empowers its users, no matter their data science expertise, to identify an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for any problem.\n",
    "Data scientists, analysts and developers across industries can use automated ML to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement machine learning solutions without extensive programming knowledge\n",
    "- Save time and resources\n",
    "- Leverage data science best practices\n",
    "- Provide agile problem-solving\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated machine learning picks an algorithm and hyperparameters for you and generates a model ready for deployment if you choose to do so. After doing so, it will create another model with a different algorithm and different hyperparameters, trying to improve upon the error metric specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like before, we first need to establish the connection to our Azure ML workspace."
